## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.8 or later (tested with v3.8)
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: [XMC5000 MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32bit-industrial-arm-cortex-m/xmc5000)


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.60.1 (`IAR`)


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [XMC5200 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/evaluation-board/KIT-XMC52-EVK) (`KIT_XMC52_EVK`)


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

The UART self-test uses the SCB6 peripheral (pins P22_0 RX, P22_1 TX) with the internal hardware loopback feature enabled. No external wiring between the TX and RX pins is required.


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one.


## Using the code example


### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*)

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target)

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Application(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**

      > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box

      > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process

</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[UART loopback test](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce243230-safety-uart-loopback-test)" application with the desired name "UART_Loopback_Test" configured for the *KIT_XMC52_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC52_EVK --app-id mtb-example-ce243230-safety-uart-loopback-test --user-app-name UART_Loopback_Test --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE

   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>

      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "MTB STL: SCB UART Safety Test" is displayed on the UART terminal

5. The serial terminal should display the result of the test

## Design and implementation

This example uses the SCB UART peripheral on the MCU to perform a self-test of the SCB peripheral. The *design.modus* file configures the DUT UART on SCB6 using pins P22_0 (RX) and P22_1 (TX) with a baud rate of 115200 and an 8N1 frame format.

The example begins by initializing the BSP configuration and setting up retarget-io for debug prints over the dedicated debug UART. The DUT UART (SCB6) is then initialized and the internal hardware loopback mode is enabled before each test call by setting the `SCB_UART_CTRL.LOOPBACK` bit. This routes the TX output directly back to the RX input inside the SCB hardware block, so no external wiring between the TX and RX pins is required.

A self-test is then run using the `SelfTest_UART_SCB()` API from the mtb-stl (https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-stl) safety library. The library transmits a byte pattern and verifies the received data against the expected values. Because the function advances an internal byte counter on each call and returns `PASS_STILL_TESTING_STATUS` until all 256 bytes have been verified, the application loops calling `uart_self_test()` until a final pass or fail status is returned. The hardware loopback bit is cleared and the FIFOs are flushed after each iteration. The PASS or FAIL result is printed to the debug UART console, and the device halts after a single complete run.

See the application notes listed in [Related resources](#related-resources) for more details.
